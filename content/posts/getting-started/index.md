These are just some of my favorite resources that have helped me get started. I still use these almost daily. I just wanted to take a moment to share with others who might be interested in getting started in cybersecurity, but aren't sure where to start. There are a lot of resources out there, but I personally feel like these are the best for getting started.

### TryHackMe

One of the first resources I learned about was [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). TryHackMe is a wonderful cybersecurity training platform that walks you through gamified lessons. You can start with the fundamentals and work your way up to more advanced lessons, or you can start wherever you'd like. I use TryHackMe often, and it's probably my favorite resource. I love how it walks you through a lesson and teaches you along the way. I find that this helps me a lot. Especially if you haven't ever done it before. So, if you're new to cybersecurity, hacking, etc., I would definitely recommend TryHackMe. The free tier is great, but I would also recommend the subscription if you can do it. It's well worth it.

### HackTheBox Academy

My next favorite resource is [HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.eu/). This is similar to TryHackMe in the sense that you can work with interactive lessons in the browser. There doesn't seem to be as much available on the free tier, but I would still highly recommend it. Again, you can start with fundamentals and work towards more advanced lessons or just begin wherever you'd like depending on your skill set. There is even a learning path called "Cracking into HackTheBox", if you'd like to learn how to sign up on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). If you want to get into pentesting and practice your skills, HackTheBox is a great place for that.
