I was invited to be on a podcast recently called, Cybersecurity 101 with Joe and Larry. As an introvert I was a little hesitant, but I'm really glad I did it. It was a great time, and Joe and Larry were awesome to chat with. It was great to step out of my comfort zone and really put myself out there. This industry is something I'm passionate about and I love talking about it. Hope you enjoy the episode despite my being nervous and feeling like I was stumbling through answers. Check out the other episodes as well, and follow Larry's journey into cybersecurity. It's a great podcast!
