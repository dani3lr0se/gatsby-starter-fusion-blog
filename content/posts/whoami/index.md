I just wanted to take this opportunity to share a bit about myself and my background with you. My name is Daniel. Feel free to call me, Dan. I'm a Navy veteran with experience in healthcare, law enforcement, and have spent the last 8 years in IT. My IT experience consists of 2 years in computer repair, 6 years in web development, and the last 5 months training and trying to transition into information security. It's been a tough journey so far, so I thought maybe it would help me if I started a blog so I can get some of my work out there for others to see. Apologies if this seems like a long brain dump and seems a bit scattered, but I have a lot to say and I just want to start putting myself out there.

## Why Information Security

My interest in information security started about a decade ago while I was working as a police officer. I had a few opportunities to attend some workshops on digital forensics, digital evidence handling, and social media investigations, which was basically learning OSINT. I was fascinated by the tech and what it could do and for a while I tried to become a member of the Vermont Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. However, due to department manpower and budget concerns I wasn't able to achieve that. I started to lose interest in law enforcement eventually anyways and began making the transition into IT. I started focusing on IT related courses as I finished up my bachelors degree and started looking for entry-level jobs to get my foot in the door.

## Transition into IT

My first IT job was a computer repair tech. I already had some knowledge of computers and enjoyed tinkering with them, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to get some experience. While working as a computer repair tech I was finishing up my BS degree, and also earned the Apple Certified Mac Tech certification. Most of my IT courses in my degree program were either security or web related. Eventually I saw an opening for a web designer position that I applied to and eventually got an offer for. I figured web technologies would be great to know and get experience with so this new role seemed like a good opportunity. 

So, for the last 6 years I was working as a web developer, specifically Drupal. I learned a lot, met some awesome people, and had some good experiences, but something about web development just didn't feel meaningful to me. I never woke up and felt excited about my job or never really felt proud to say what I did. It just felt a little empty to me. Don't get wrong, it's a good career, and there is nothing wrong with it. It just wasn't for me. Having been in the military, law enforcement, and healthcare, I always felt the need to find something meaningful. I like helping others and or help making a positive impact in some way. This is a big reason why I always liked information security. Working in infosec literally has opportunities to help protect our nation's infrastructure, businesses, and other meaningful opportunities such as working towards protecting our children from predators. This is what I would be excited about or proud to say I did. This is why I want a job in information security. I want to do something meaningful to me and something that I wake up feeling excited about.

## The Journey So Far

Last December, 2020, I was laid off from my web development job. As much as it sucked, I felt as though it was a blessing in disguise. I decided to take the opportunity to do whatever I could to finally tranisition into information security. I began working earning certifications such as AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, CompTIA Security+, and LPI Linux Essentials. I even felt comfortable enough to try the CompTIA PenTest+ exam. Prior to getting laid off I was given the opportunity to start the OSCP pentesting with Kali Linux course which was why I felt comfortable with the PenTest+ exam. I ended up taking a break from the OSCP course to work on other foundational, more broad skillsets such as what I mentioned earlier. I felt like the OSCP training was a little too focused for me as I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do in the infosec field.

Every day I am working on something. I am either working through rooms on TryHackMe, working on a Battlepath on RangeForce, a challenge on Cyberdefenders.org, or studying for a certification. I spend all of my free time, which is literally all I have these days, working on something to learn or improve my skillset. I also work though courses on Udemy, Codecademy, and have recently started working through training on the Fortinet site as well. I applied to the FortiVet program after someone on LinkedIn recommended it to me. I'll update on that later if it takes me anywhere.

On top of all of this training, etc., I have been applying to probably hundreds of companies to try and get a job in infosec. I've been getting more interviews as I get more certifications, etc., but have only been getting rejections so far. It's been painful because I know I can do this work and do it well. I just need an opportunity to prove myself. I can promise you I'd work as hard, if not harder, than most other folks. I'm driven, enthusiastic, and genuinely love this field. It's very engaging for me because I feel like it's meaningful. I didn't feel this way about web development. I wake up every day feeling ready to learn and solve some interesting challenges when I go through these infosec trainings, courses, etc. 

## Final Thoughts

Apologies for the length of this article. I'm not usually a man of many words, but I felt the need to get some thoughts out as I go on this journey. It's been a rollercoaster so far for the past 5 months, but it's a journey that I am glad I started. I'm excited to see where it takes me and looking forward to learning as much as I can, meeting some more awesome people along the way, and hopefully landing a job somewhere soon.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, if you made it this far. I'm grateful for your time.
